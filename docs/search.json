    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

However, of note the single unemployed person is among the tallest across all 3 classifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we examine a scatterplot of weight against annual salary in USD we observe that those with middle of the road weights tended to make the most money, with those over- or under-weight earning less.\nOn the whole it would seem that our simulated data tells the story of pretty privilege, with those that are taller and of well-adjusted weights being more likely to be employed full-time and high-earners.\n\nprint(linearmodel)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term           estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  157.       23.8          6.61  0.00119\n2 Salary         0.000190  0.000351     0.541 0.612  \n3 EmploymentPT  -6.74     19.0         -0.355 0.737  \n\n\nExamining a linear model of height as a function of salary and employment status we see predictably no statistical significance for either predictor variables as, in addition to being simulated data, the relationship in question is dubious and nonsensical at best."

    "text": "My name is Sean O’Sullivan and I’m a data analyst at Disney. I have an Bachelor of Science in Economics from Texas A&M University – College Station and have taken a handful of undergraduate statistics, calculus, and econometrics courses as a result. I’ve always been fascinated with technology and enjoy tinkering – whether that means building mechanical keyboards or tinkering with software and programming languages.\nAs I’ve gotten older that fascination with technology, how it works, and what impacts it has on stakeholders in society has only grown. I often find myself frequenting articles about the changing internet landscape, transitions to sustainable energy, and (perhaps unsurprisingly given my undergraduate degree) the profound ways that access to new data driven technologies shape the economic opportunities of whole communities around the globe.\nAs I’ve moved further into my career as a data analyst I’ve found myself drawn to the more advanced and technical side of things like data engineering and specifically data science. It’s my aim with my MSDA degree (and an accompanying graduate certification in data science) to spend a lot less of my future career conceptualizing dashboards in Tableau and a lot more focused in designing reproducible analysis pipelines that are statistically and methodologically sound so that the work I do can generate more significant insights and inform product level decisions.\nHowever, my interests are more varied than simply technology and data. For instance at an earlier point in my career as a workforce analyst, when it seemed my data analysis journey had stalled, I considered quitting my job and starting work full-time as a photographer. I’d spent years doing part-time work and taking on event gigs for local bands and nonprofits, friends’ weddings, professional headshots, etc. and I found that creative process to be incredibly freeing and less dependent on a trajectory charted out by an established, objective industry like data. I was ultimately insistent that I develop my data skillset, but the very real possibility that I might not be here today underscores how valuable I think artistic pursuits and hobbies can be to revitalizing your ambition. As a result I make a conscious effort to take time to either appreciate art or engage in creativity myself. If you’d like to connect with me professionally you can visit my LinkedIn.\n\nData Resources I Recommend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Scientist Show\nA data science podcast hosted by Daliana Liu that covers topics from machine learning techniques to tools and job hunting. I find it helpful for reinforcing what I’ve learned so far as well as an avenue for new topics of interest to discover.\n\n\nMatt Harrison’s Python for Data Science Books\nI’ve surveyed a few of Matt Harrison’s courses that he’s helped to author for the likes of Coursera, edX, and Pluralsight and have found his teaching style to be really easily to follow and the material is always something that can be directly and actively applied as you’re going through the learning process. He also makes for a strong follow as a regular contributor to data science discourse on LinkedIn. I’ve personally recently purchased his Effective Pandas 2 book in order to refine my data wrangling skills.\n\n\n#TidyTuesday\nThis is a link to the Tidy Tuesday hashtag on Twitter. In the fall semester of my MSDA degree I would regularly check out the various different interpretations of the same dataset that novice and experienced analysts alike were sharing. While I have less experience in R than I do in Python, I’m always impressed by the high-level of polish with which you can visualize in R. This hashtag helps to keep me inspired.\n\n\nDatawrapper\nThis blog keeps me honest about the various considerations for effective and professional looking data visualizations. I highly recommend perusing it whenever you’re looking to ensure you are utilizing visualization best practices."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/sean.osullivan/Documents/MDSA/Summer 2024/Practicum II/Practicum GitHub Repo\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
