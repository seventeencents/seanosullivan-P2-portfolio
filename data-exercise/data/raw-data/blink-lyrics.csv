blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,Anthem Part 3,1,"Everything that we've tried
We'll keep waking up to that light
We'll see rising of a new tide
We are starting up a new life
When your head is hanging too low
When your heart is 'bout to explode
You can make it anywhere, go
There's no fear when you get here, give up that ghost

When your dreams, they seem like they're dead
Like a pounding deep in your head
When your job has gone to deep shit
If you've fallen off of that list
When you're clenching both of your fists
Like you aimed and then you just missed
Let the record show that you're fixed
Don't you give up now, just get up and resist

This time, I won't be complacent
The dreams I gave up and wasted
A new high, a new ride and I'm on fire
My old shit ends here tonight

And after you had the time of your life
Flatlined and led toward the light
You'll despair the wreckage and find
No one gave a fuck that you died

This time, I won't be complacent
The dreams I gave up and wasted
A new high, a new ride and I'm on fire
My old shit ends here tonight

It's my head, it's my mind
All made up, it's alright
If I fall on some nails
If I win or set sail
I won't fail
I won't fail"
blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,Dance With Me,2,"Don't think, maybe she won't refuse
She knows everything that I think
That girl, prettiest I could lose
My game's shittiest I could be
I've been waiting around to lose
So dumb, trying to make believe
You're mine, what are you gonna do?
Come here, do you want to come dance with me?

Tellin' your friends you know you want to (Dance with me)
Shaking those hips like the devil's got you (Dance with me)
Waiting all night 'cause now I want you (Dance with me)
Eyeing that chance, here we go, I got you (Dance with me)

Olé, olé, olé, olé
Yeah, we're doing it all night long

This song is making me beg for more
These drinks are breaking up old routines
My mind pushing me out the door
So fucked, wishing I weren't so green
Me, you, won't you just fall in love?
Like me, or am I just too naive?
Tonight it's getting a bit too rough
But now, really wanting to make her scream

Tellin' your friends you know you want to (Dance with me)
Shaking those hips like the devil's got you (Dance with me)
Waiting all night 'cause now I want you (Dance with me)
Eyeing that chance, here we go, I got you (Dance with me)

Olé, olé, olé, olé
Yeah, we're doing it all night long

You beat my heart from miles away
Yeah, we're doing it all night long
You spin me like a hurricane
Yeah, we're doing it all night long
You love to play your little games
Yeah, we're playing them all night long
I'd like to have you every day, every way
And do it all night long"
blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,Fell In Love,3,"Late nights, feelin' kinda lonely
Drive home, no one's waiting for me
I don't miss the days before I fell for you
Last time was fun, but overrated
White lines fun, but then you hate it
Cruel hearts and nobody could break it
Sad but true

And honestly (When I look back)
I needed you (When I look back)
You needed me, it's crazy

Do you remember the time when we first met?
You were at a party with your ex
I said hello, then I got drunk
Do you remember the time we fell in love?
And you remember the night when you came over?
Playin' songs, laying on my shoulder
We made out 'til the sun came up
Do you remember the time
Remember the time we fell in love?

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah

How could I ever forget layin' in your bed
Having sex all night, it's fucking with my head
Now we can never pretend that we can only be friends
We should do it again and again

And honestly (When I look back)
I needed you (When I look back)
You needed me, it's crazy

You were at a party with your ex
I said hello, then I got drunk

blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,Terrified,4,"I can't feel my body
And nothing else here matters at all
The shapes become electric
Innocence and magic for all
I'm liftin' past the skyline
And no one seems to notice my fall
In and out the timelines
Now I see the truth of it all

We'll go (Oh-oh)
Terrified (Oh-oh)
We'll go (Oh-oh)
Terrified

Laughter from the children
The streets are made of silence for you
I will reach the summit
To hold you in my arms with a view

We'll go (Oh-oh)

From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends

Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky

Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time

One more time
One more
One more time
One more time

I miss you, took time, but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time ain't always gonna happen
I gotta say ""I love you"" while we're here

Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time

One more time
One more
One more time

One more time

I miss you"
blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,More Than You Know,6,"Your bed is the last battlefield, a nuclear weapon
Let's search and destroy all the innocent throats we can step on
You bury your face underneath half-hearted confessions
You poison yourself with the thought I won't love you to death

Black lights across my face!
Words that we'll never write!
Wait for the phone to ring!
Back to the starting line, go!

I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
I don't feel shame, I don't have highs, but I've got some lows
I feel a bit cursed, I've been numb and sinking down like a stone
I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
More than you'd know!

I shook all the leaves from your tree and left you with nothing
I can't see the colors you see, they won't see me coming
The ivy is starting to creep, it grows through the awnings
It's dawning on me that I shouldn't be trying at all

Black lights across my face!
Words that we'll never write!
Wait for the phone to ring!
Back to the starting line, go!

I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
I don't feel shame, I don't have highs, but I've got some lows
I feel a bit cursed, I've been numb and sinking down like a stone
I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
More than you'd know!

It goes on and on, I swear we don't belong
On and on (We're lonely), I swear we don't belong (Wherever)
(Too tongue-tied forever)
It goes on and on (We're lonely), I swear it don't belong (Whenever)
(Too tongue-tied forever)

I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
I don't feel shame, I don't have highs, but I've got some lows
I feel a bit cursed, I've been numb and sinking down like a stone
I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
More than you'd know!"
blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,Turn This Off!,7,"If you're too sensitive, well turn this off
If you're offended by these words, then please fuck off
If you're an asshole (Oh-oh) with a dick, then that's something I can lick
Then maybe we can call ourselves proctologists

When I first took you out to sushi on a date
You took me home, I sadly pumped away
On your stomach (Oh-oh), face or ass, it's your fault that I came fast
So don't blame it on me, that's a you thing"
blink-182,One More Time…,10/20/23,When We Were Young,8,"When we were young, the world felt so small (Felt so small)
When we were young, nothing could break us apart (Break us apart)
Do you know your eyes are like stars? (Are like stars)
Summer nights, making out in my car (In my car)

When we were young
Are you still riding free like every other?
When we were young
Nothing's too fast 'cause we've run together
When we were young
Do you still think of me or maybe ever?
When we were young
Losing something we had when we were younger

Back in the day, we used to say, ""Fuck them all"" (Fuck them all)
Prodigal sons were second to none, they gave me a job (Gave me a job)
Now I'm stuck at work like a typical jerk with nowhere to go (Nowhere to go)
We fell out of touch, now everything sucks, I'm out on my own (Out on my own)

When we were young
Are you still riding free like every other?
When we were young
Nothing's too fast 'cause we've run together
When we were young
Do you still think of me or maybe ever?

They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?

They say, ""You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way""

No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (This way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?

Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road

I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (This way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?

Nightmare, daydream (No, oh no, oh no, oh no)
You can't save me (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

No way, no, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (Shit)
Oh no, I leave them broken-hearted

Long weeks of impending doom

You don't know what you've got, 'til it's almost gone
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got, 'til it's over

Another day in the life
You can't look me in the eye
There's nothing left you could say
It wouldn't help anyway
This poison skin you can't touch
Go on without me, my love
No kiss to send you away
It wouldn't help anyway

You don't know what you've got

Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine
Delete the progress on your game

From the loudest songs on your mixtape

No silence, no help here
Nobody came running up
By my side

Do you wanna come to a party?
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house, but people are cool there
Reluctant, I followed, but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I payed my three in and the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party

And then, in the backyard, some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame, all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game, I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn, or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night, I learned some girls try too hard

(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And some girls try too hard to impress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With the way that they dress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With those things on their chests
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping, the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup, her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her, but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that some girls try too hard
